# Vocally

 A friendly wrapper around the Web Speech API (VoiceRecognition and VoiceSynthesis) for JavaScript.

 The Web Speech API includes two main parts:

 - [SpeechSynthesis][] - teaching your page to talk. [Works in most modern browsers][can-i-use-synthesis].
 - [SpeechRecognition][] - teaching your page to listen. [Currently Chrome only][can-i-use-recognition], but [can be polyfilled with commercial APIs][bing-polyfill].

 Vocally is an easy to use JavaScript API for interacting with both.

## Installation

### NPM

`npm install vocally --save`

### Yarn

`yarn add vocally`

## Usage

- `import { vocally } from 'vocally';`

### Making it speak

The basic API:

- `vocally.say('Hello!')` - read a single string out loud
- `vocally.read(someElement)` - read out all of the text in an element
- `vocally.pauseFor(3)` - add a gap before saying the next thing
- `vocally.pause()` - pause where you are at
- `vocally.resume()` - resume from where you paused
- `vocally.togglePlaying()` - pause or resume
- `vocally.onSpeak(utterance => console.log('we said', utterance))` - receive a callback every time a new "utterance" is spoken - useful for providing a visual alternative for those who prefer reading to listening.

You can chain these together:

```js
vocally
	.say("Alright, let's read this article!")
	.pause(2)
	.read(document.querySelector('article'))
	.onSpeak(utterance => textAlternative.innerText = utterance.text);
```

And helpers:

- `vocally.synthesis.getVoices(): Array<SpeechSynthesisVoice>`
- `vocally.synthesis.getDefaultVoice(): SpeechSynthesisVoice`

### Making it listen

- `vocally.listenOnce(): Recognizer` - listen for the first recognition result - suitable for a single short sentence, input or command.
- `vocally.listen(): Recognizer` - keep transcribing until you tell it to stop.
- `vocally.listenFor(command)` or `vocally.listenFor([command1, command2, ...])`

  Simple example:

  ```js
  vocally.listenFor([
	  {
		  command: 'up',
		  respondOnDraft: false, // execute even if it's a draft response
		  handler: () => window.scrollTo(0, window.pageYOffset - 100)
	  },
	  {
		  command: 'down',
		  respondOnDraft: false, // execute even if it's a draft response
		  handler: () => window.scrollTo(0, window.pageYOffset + 100)
	  }
  ])
  ```

  Your commands and alternatives are treated as regular expressions, so you can do wildcard matches:

  ```js
  vocally.listenFor({
	command: 'my name is (\w+)',
	alternatives: ['I am (\w+)', 'you can call me (\w+)'],
	handler: (matched) => {
		// matched: { command: 'I am (\w+)', alternative: 'i am jason', matches: ['i am jason', 'jason'] }
		let name = matched.wildcards[1];
		vocally.say(`Hello ${name}`);
	}
  })
  ```

- `vocally.stopListening()`

## Project details

### Getting support

Please open an issue on Github if you need help using Vocally.

### Contributing

I would love help in the following areas:

- Creating documentation and examples
- Pull requests - help us build the project!
- Setting up continuous integration and cross-browser tests

If you're a junior developer and would like to contribute, but are not sure where to start - ask me, via email (jason@jasono.co) or by opening a Github issue to discuss.

### The name

I chose the name because it's a relevant word that wasn't already taken (*The first page of Google results for `vocally js` produced nothing to do with software at the time I chose it*).

I also liked how I imagined the API methods would sound: `vocally.say()`, `vocally.read()`, `vocally.listen()`.

Finally, I thought it was a node to the Accessibility community, which often uses the numeronym "a11y" (or "ally") as an abbreviation - because I had the idea for this project starting at the Perth Web Accessibility Camp in 2018, and I believe the biggest opportunity for this technology is to make the web inclusive to more people in more ways.
